# dfs-basic

Nothing fancy! 
Plain old implementation of dfs of a graph using adjacency list representation. 
Sample graph is implemented with 5 vertices and each of the program is able to traverse through them using DFS algorithm.

Failed cases:
Might fail for graphs with cycle[will be updated on next release]
